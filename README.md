# Git Manager

## How to use it

### Build

`go run make.go`
		
### Use

## When to use it

I did it to scratch my itch, while working with many small repositories for the same project I had to keep updating them individually, that was tedious and easy to lose track.

## What it is

It's a simple tool to manage many repositories without the hassle of doing one by one and manually.

## What it's not

It's not a git wrapper. So, keep using your git-fu on your projects.
